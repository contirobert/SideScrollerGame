## Overview

SideScrollerGame is a basic side-scrolling game template built with C++ and Unreal Engine 5. The character runs on a randomized, endless map, jumping and dodging obstacles, all while continuing to outrun the deadly wall. The game's components explore the very basics of working with Unreal, such as:

- C++ Classes
- Blueprints
- Action/Axis Mappings (Input)
- Collision
- Spawning
- Static Meshes
- Level Building

## Custom Features

Additional features I will be implementing include:

- Character and map textures
- Scoring System
- Respawn Animations
